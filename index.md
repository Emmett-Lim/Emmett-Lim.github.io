### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was a favorite because it was really interesting to make animations play on the terminal itself. Sure despite the fact that the coding was mostly following the directions from the TODO comments, but atleast finishing the entire code and then seeing what the results looked like for this part was nice. One thing that I have learned within lab 8 part 3 was a little bit of std::chrono and the usage of sleep_for() function to pause the program's execution.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, parts 1 and 2 were my favorites because within these labs, we learned a little bit more about the usage of .h files and how function definitions and data members are part of this file. The main thing that I liked about both part 1 and 2 of lab 11 was the use of constructors and creating class objects. By learning how part of object-oriented programming works in C++, I feel like it really helped me understand more about how to code in C++.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite of mine because I was able to learn how to make a gif through the use of Magick. Even though I used Magick to make a colored image in Lab 10, part 3, I didn't know how Magick really worked and how to use it. Now, within lab 12 part 1, I was able to understand parts, perhaps most, of Magick and how to create an image from scratch; although I will probably still need to use it more often to actually fully understand it. Besides learning about Magick, I also liked the process of creating the gif itself by making multiple frames and updating each pixel, looping htrough the row and columns of the image frame.
